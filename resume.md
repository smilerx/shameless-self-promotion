###print('Hello World!')
I've always loved interactive computer programs. I suppose that, for me, it started with the original Nintendo.  I still remember how awesome it was to search dungeons with Link, blast through hordes of aliens as Samus Aran, and save the world as the Black Night turned Paladin Cecil in Final Fantasy 2.

These days, I'm looking to join a group of other folks to work with who want to combine great UI/UX vision with uncompromising technical innovation to make awesome software together.

##Experience
###The Doula Exchange

	class DoulaExchange(object):
		my_roles = 'Creator/Founder'
		from_date = 'Nov. 2012'
		to_date = 'Current'
		
#####Summary  
I created the Doula Exchange (www.doulaexchange.com) to provide a way for prospective parents to quickly and easily connect with caring and professional doulas in their local areas.  The idea arose after experiencing the poor quality of doula listing websites currently available on the internet when we were looking for a doula for the birth of one of our children.

Since our launch in late November 2012, we've registered nearly 200 doulas for our service and grown a Facebook community from nothing to 100+ people.

Projects
Academic Services for Student Athletes Web Application
October 2011 to February 2012 Members:Michael Dunn, Chris Corrente
Role: Notre Dame's Technical Lead & Developer
Summary: The ASSA Web Application was a joint project between Notre Dame and a 3rd party .Net developer to convert/replace an complex, but outdated Access database.
IrishPay Electronic Refunds
April 2012 to August 2012 Members:Michael Dunn, Chris Corrente
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My Role: Notre Dame's Technical Lead & Developer -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------
Project Summary
-------------------------------------------
For a number of years, Notre Dame has accepted electronic payments, but has been severely limited in its ability to process electronic refunds. This resulted in a significant PR issue for the University, which was being seen as eager to take money, but slow to return it.
My role as technical lead required interfacing with staff from multiple functional areas of the University to (1) correctly identify the functional and technical requirements of creating an interface between our Banner ERP system and a 3rd party vendor to process electronic refunds and (2) implement that interface.
-------------------------------------------
Project Results
-------------------------------------------
My internal customer is very pleased with the results the project. Since go-live, the system has processed over 10 million dollars in electronic refunds. Additionally, we have reduced costs and solved a significant PR issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- Role: Project Manager and Platform/API Developer -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------
Project Summary
-------------------------------------------
One of the major challenges we face at Notre Dame is a giant amount of technical debt that has arisen as a result of violating the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle of code management.
One of the areas in which this has been evident is related to programmed file management tasks. In short, developers have historically created individual Bash/Perl scripts to manage routine management tasks. This resulted in a really large number of scripts that basically did the same thing, increased maintenance times, and slowed new product development.
I took on the project manager/technical lead role for the development of a new file management API to address these issues.
-------------------------------------------
Project Results
-------------------------------------------
Developers in the Office of Information Technologies have begun to utilize the new file management tools. The API allows developers to automate file transfers, encryption/decryption, zip/unzip, and archive/unarchive/delete operations without writing any scripts themselves.
As a result, our maintenance codebase is shrinking (yeah!) and developers are able to spend more of their time working on delivering product features rather than coding boilerplate file management operations.


##Recommendations
#####Sergio Porres, Developer, University of Notre Dame
"Michael is driven by a passion for greatness but he is different from the norm in that part of his vision is to take everyone with him. Michael's desire for excellence is matched by his inclusive approach to problem-solving. He listens well and perceptively and has a talent for putting together unique perspectives to realize a greater whole. As a problem solver, Michael can break down complex ideas into their simpler components. Beyond his soft-skills, Michael is also a forward-thinking innovator who truly understands technology. He has great ambitions for leveraging technology accross the full spectrum of life, and the know-how to deliver creative yet realistic ideas and solutions. Essentially, Michael gets both the forest and the trees and his passion is infectious."

#####Shobha Kamat, Senior Application Developer, University of Notre Dame
"I worked with Michael Dunn on a project which contained transferring files from one server to the other.It required encrypting decrypting files. He streamlined the process beautifully using python scripts. He was very meticulous and resolved many issues we encountered on the way. It was a pleasure working with him."

#####Adam Freehling, Associate Application Developer, University of Notre Dame
"Michael is always a great team member to work with. He constantly is striving to improve processes and development techniques within our organization. He is very knowledgeable on a variety of technologies and encourages learning and promoting growth in others. Most recently I have worked with Michael on developing “Code Camps” within our organization to promote the learning of the python programming language and teaching the django web framework."

#####Chris Corrente, Manager, Student/Faculty Information Systems, University of Notre Dame
"Mike went above and beyond his responsibilities on the ASSA project. His main assignment was to develop database views for the contractor so that information could be retrieved from our Student Information System. However, as the project progressed, it became apparent that the contractor required some guidance in his development of the web application, and Mike stepped up to provide that guidance, including reviewing the developer's code and helping him determine the best way to implement certain solutions. He also became the main point person for the customer, helping define requirements and design the solution to satisfy their needs. His sense of humor was most welcome on the project, helping keep us loose even during stressful moments."
